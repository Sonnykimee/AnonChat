# AnonChat
AnonChat is a Spigot plugin that allows players to chat anonymously. AnonChat can protect players from losing multiplayer access caused by the recently added Player Report System in Minecraft version 1.19.84.

NOTE: It's a very simple plugin that is written in a single class. I could to add more flexibility to the plugin, make it more customizable... but do I really want to spend time on that? Eh, maybe later :)

# Commands
/anon - Hide your nickname on chat.

# Permissions
anon.use - Use anon command.

#About License
Any software that is linked to GPLv2 software must be redistributed as GPLv2. Spigot API is licensed under GPLv2, and this plugin imports Spigot API classes at compile time which mean when it is compiled, the plugin will be GPLv2 software. However, this project file itself does not include the Spigot API jar file, and I am releasing my source codes under the MIT license which does not require derivatives to be distributed under the same license. The Binary (.jar) release of this plugin is GPLv2.
