# AnonChat
AnonChat is a Spigot plugin that allows players to chat anonymously. AnonChat can protect players from losing multiplayer access caused by the recently added Player Report System in Minecraft version 1.19.84.

NOTE: It's a very simple plugin that is written in a single class. I could to add more flexibility to the plugin, make it more customizable... but do I really want to spend time on that? Eh, maybe later :)

# Commands
/anon - Hide your nickname on chat.

# Permissions
anon.use - Use anon command.
